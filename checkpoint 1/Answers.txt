2. ping 8.8.8.8

The ping command sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a target host to test network connectivity.

The IP address 8.8.8.8 belongs to Google Public DNS and is commonly used because it is reliable and almost always reachable.

The objective of running this command is to verify that the Kali Linux VM has internet access and can communicate with external networks.

2.1. traceroute 8.8.8.8

The traceroute command shows the path that packets take from the Kali Linux VM to the destination IP.

It takes multiple hops to reach Google’s DNS server; in this case, it took 13 hops, depending on the network path and ISP routing.

Each line represents a router (hop) between the source and destination, including the response time for that hop.

3. IP Addresses of Kali and Windows

The IP address of the Kali Linux VM was identified using the ip a command.

The IP address of the Windows host machine was identified using the ipconfig command.

Communication depends on the VirtualBox network mode used; it is usually not possible in NAT mode but works in Bridged mode.
