2. ping 8.8.8.8

The ping command sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a target host to test network connectivity.

The IP address 8.8.8.8 belongs to Google Public DNS and is commonly used because it is reliable and almost always reachable.

The objective of running this command is to verify that the Kali Linux VM has internet access and can communicate with external networks.

2.1. traceroute 8.8.8.8

The traceroute command shows the path that packets take from the Kali Linux VM to the destination IP.

It takes multiple hops to reach Google’s DNS server; in this case, it took 13 hops, depending on the network path and ISP routing.

Each line represents a router (hop) between the source and destination, including the response time for that hop.

3. IP Addresses of Kali and Windows

The IP address of the Kali Linux VM was identified using the ip a command.

The IP address of the Windows host machine was identified using the ipconfig command.

A ping test was performed between the two machines.

Communication depends on the VirtualBox network mode used; it is usually not possible in NAT mode but works in Bridged mode.

4. VirtualBox Network Modes (NAT vs Bridged)

NAT mode allows the VM to access the internet but prevents direct communication with the host.

Bridged Adapter mode connects the VM directly to the same network as the host.

The VM is able to ping the host machine and vice versa when using Bridged Adapter mode.

This happens because both machines receive IP addresses from the same network and can communicate directly.

5. XAMPP Installation on Windows

XAMPP was successfully installed on the Windows machine.

Apache and MySQL services were started from the XAMPP Control Panel.

The local web server environment was confirmed to be running correctly.

6. Accessing the XAMPP Default Web Page

The local web server was accessed using http://localhost.

The IP address 127.0.0.1 was also used to access the server.

These addresses point to the local machine itself (loopback interface).

7. Modifying the XAMPP index.html File

The index.html file located in C:\xampp\htdocs\ was edited.

The full name of the user was added to the page.

The page was refreshed in the browser to verify the change.

The modification was displayed successfully on the web page.

8. Accessing XAMPP from Kali Linux

An attempt was made to access the XAMPP web server from Kali Linux using the Windows host IP address.

Access was successful only when the VM network mode was set to Bridged Adapter.

In NAT mode, access failed due to network isolation.

Disabling or allowing Apache through the Windows Firewall was necessary to allow external access.

Apache had to be running and both machines needed to be on the same network.

9. Nmap Scan of the Windows Host

The nmap -sV <IP_of_Host> command was used from Kali Linux.

Open ports such as port 80 (HTTP) were detected.

The web server was identified as Apache with its version displayed.

The database server (MySQL) was detected on port 3306 with its version information, if accessible.
